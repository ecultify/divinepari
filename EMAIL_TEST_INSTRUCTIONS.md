# Email and Poster Display Bug Fix - Testing Instructions

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Email Not Being Sent After Poster Generation
### 2. Gender Option Display Bug in Incognito Mode

## Changes Made:

### Email Fix:
1. **Updated SMTP Configuration**: Changed from SSL (port 465) to TLS (port 587) for better compatibility
2. **Improved SMTP Implementation**: Added comprehensive error handling and proper TLS negotiation
3. **Enhanced Authentication**: Better username/password handling with detailed error messages
4. **Fallback Mechanism**: Primary SMTP with mail() function fallback

### Poster Display Fix:
1. **Image Preloading**: Added preloading of all poster images to prevent caching issues
2. **Error Handling**: Added retry mechanism for failed image loads
3. **Optimized Loading**: Set `loading="eager"` and `decoding="sync"` for immediate display
4. **Cache Prevention**: Added error handling to retry with cache-busting parameters

## Testing Instructions:

### Test 1: Email Functionality
1. Go to your poster generation page
2. Complete the poster generation process
3. Check if you receive an email at the provided address
4. Check server logs for any SMTP errors:
   ```bash
   tail -f /path/to/error.log | grep "DIVINE EMAIL"
   ```

### Test 2: Poster Display in Incognito Mode
1. **Normal Browser Test**:
   - Open the site in a normal browser window
   - Go to gender selection, choose "Male"
   - Verify you see: Option1M, Option2M, Option3M (all different images)

2. **Incognito Mode Test**:
   - Open the site in incognito/private browsing mode
   - Go to gender selection, choose "Male"
   - Verify you see: Option1M, Option2M, Option3M (all different images)
   - Should NOT see Option3M repeated twice

### Debugging Steps:

#### If emails still don't work:
1. Check if the email credentials are correct:
   - Username: support@posewithdivine.com
   - Password: Support_@_123
   - Host: smtp.hostinger.com
   - Port: 587 (TLS)

2. Test SMTP connection manually:
   ```bash
   telnet smtp.hostinger.com 587
   # Should connect successfully
   ```

3. Check Hostinger email account:
   - Ensure the email account exists and is active
   - Check if the password is correct
   - Verify SMTP is enabled for the account

#### If poster display still has issues:
1. Check browser console for image loading errors
2. Verify all image files exist:
   - `/public/images/posters/Option1M.avif`
   - `/public/images/posters/Option2M.avif`
   - `/public/images/posters/Option3M.webp`

3. Check network tab to see if images are loading correctly

## File Changes Made:

1. `/public/api/send-email.php` - Improved SMTP implementation
2. `/public/env.php` - Changed SMTP port from 465 to 587
3. `/src/app/generate/poster/page.tsx` - Added image preloading and error handling

## Root Causes Identified:

### Email Issue:
- **SMTP Authentication**: The previous configuration used SSL on port 465, but many hosting providers prefer TLS on port 587
- **Error Handling**: The original code had insufficient error reporting
- **Connection Method**: The socket connection wasn't properly handling TLS negotiation

### Poster Display Issue:
- **Image Format Inconsistency**: Option3M uses `.webp` while others use `.avif`
- **Browser Caching**: Incognito mode has stricter caching policies
- **Loading Strategy**: Images weren't preloaded, causing race conditions

## Expected Results:
- ✅ Emails should be sent successfully after poster generation
- ✅ All three poster options should display correctly in both normal and incognito modes
- ✅ No duplicate poster images should appear
- ✅ Better error logging for debugging

## Next Steps if Issues Persist:
1. Verify Hostinger SMTP credentials
2. Check email account quotas and limits
3. Consider alternative email providers (SendGrid, Gmail SMTP)
4. Convert Option3M.webp to Option3M.avif for complete format consistency
